The world is raining. The trees, with greens dark or light, stand eerily still in the rain, as if their reticent souls have retreated within. Humans, on the contrary, react with amplified movement, they start running, toward shelters where their souls could perhaps retreat. They dash under a roof! Only to find themselves soaked through and through, with rain, of another kind.

Biking home in drizzling rain at dusk, I saw a person holding onto a sign post, their body leaning over the edge of the sidewalk, toward the traffic on El Camino highway. I feared they wanted to end their life, or to play with death. I sped past them in fear, their face a blur. When I parked my bike and smelled dinner, I felt a nondescript anguish. The image of the person, an antiquated balloon skin, hanging from that post, unmoving, in drizzling rain at dusk.
