<p>I look at you in a way that I can only because I've looked at you this way before.</p>
<br>

<p>Lately I've been tired and I've been wanting to cry<br>
I've become scared of people so I hide<br>
I felt like I should celebrate today, today I turn 23! But I didn't know how.<br>
I've always known how.</p>
<br>

<p>Mom knows me, she said I should write something. I wouldn't be satisfied if I didn't. I agree but what is there to write that I haven't written in my journal before? I feel no strong desire to write, nothing begs to be written.</p>
<br>

<p>It's funny how my birthday occurs during a time of sadness after weeks and weeks of bliss. I have a sense of how this sadness came about, tension between working for M and D and working for myself, applications for PhDs and scholarships.</p>
<br>

<p>See the red grass in Lagunita meadow dancing in the setting sun. To wear the coat of light! I want to wear the coat of light.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe the point is not to expel sadness. But when sadness arises, to embrace it with compassion and gratitude. Maybe it's sadness's way to reassure me he has not left me, like that younger me always feared and thus held on to sadness so tightly. He says, go be happy and fully happy, and know that you have not lost me, I'm always here if you need me, to connect with your past self, to speak poetry, to rest from being too happy, to adjust and turn, or even just to feel me deeply for the sake of that.</p>
<br>

<p>I'm not here to chain you down. I'm here to free you.</p>

<p><strong>To C on her 23rd birthday</strong><br>
<em>From C</em></p>
<br>

<p>A wave from the ocean has taken your name<br>
It dances and it twirls, it gazes at the sky<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, when it's tired, closes its eyes</p>
<br>

<p>May your joy run deep as deep as sadness sleeps<br>
May work and rest be equally revered<br>
May you walk forth with no fear<br>
Give all of you to the present, at every beat<br>
Serve those who are far, and those who are near</p>
<br>

<p>Be light unto yourself<br>
May your heart be still and still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feel, and heal, and reveal<br>
May you hold, and be held with care<br>
Bear witness with awe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the common and the rare</p>
<br>

<p>Say I love you right out loud<br>
But love with consistency and no sound<br>
Be humble always, and proud when in doubt</p>
<br>

<p>You have taken the name of a wave<br>
You dance and you twirl, you gaze at the sky<br>
Before you return to the ocean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come close, come close to me now</p>
